## Exercise 3: Analyze Reports

WhiteSource bolt automatically detects OpenSource components in the software including transitive dependencies and their respective licenses.

### Security Dashboard

The security dashboard shows the vulnerability of the build.
This report shows the list of all vulnerable open source components with **Vulnerability Score, Vulnerable Libraries, Severity Distribution**.

You can see the opensource license distribution and a detailed view of all components and links to their metadata and licensed references.
