## Working with Channels

**Channels** are dedicated sections within a team to keep conversations organized by specific topics, projects, disciplinesâ€”-whatever works for your team!

- Team channels are places where everyone on the team can openly have conversations. Private chats are only visible to those people in the chat.

- Channels are most valuable when extended with apps that include tabs, connectors, and bots that increase their value to the members of the team.
